#Lexical_Analyzer
This is lexical analyser project I made it to analyse the code and break to lexemes,
then gather it to tokens, after that the analyser analyses if the token is identifier, Keyword, Operator, or Brackets,
after this operation the program gives the user the outputs of all tokens and types.
